### Problem Statement
The contemporary music industry grapples with several centralization challenges, adversely impacting both artists and consumers. Existing music streaming platforms necessitate centralized databases for storing critical user information (such as signup and credit card details), enabling efficient application usage. However, the advent of Web 5 technology offers a transformative solutionâ€”leveraging Decentralized Identifiers (DID) and Decentralized Web Names (DWN) enables the decentralization of user data, granting individuals personalized access to their information.

Furthermore, the current structure of music data, confined within isolated silos owned by various companies, results in limited agency for artists and suboptimal user experiences. This centralized ownership dynamic creates an imbalance in the industry, disadvantaging artists and diminishing the quality of the overall user experience. The integration of decentralized technologies promises to address these issues, fostering a more equitable and user-centric music ecosystem.
