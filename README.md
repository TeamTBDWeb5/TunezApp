# TunezApp
# PROJECT PROPOSAL
### Problem Statement
The contemporary music industry grapples with several centralization challenges, adversely impacting both artists and consumers. Existing music streaming platforms necessitate centralized databases for storing critical user information (such as signup and credit card details), enabling efficient application usage. However, the advent of Web 5 technology offers a transformative solutionâ€”leveraging Decentralized Identifiers (DID) and Decentralized Web Names (DWN) enables the decentralization of user data, granting individuals personalized access to their information.

Furthermore, the current structure of music data, confined within isolated silos owned by various companies, results in limited agency for artists and suboptimal user experiences. This centralized ownership dynamic creates an imbalance in the industry, disadvantaging artists and diminishing the quality of the overall user experience. The integration of decentralized technologies promises to address these issues, fostering a more equitable and user-centric music ecosystem.

### Solution
1. With Web 5, users can enjoy comprehensive access to their data through their Decentralized Identifiers (DID) without the necessity of additional information such as login details or credit information. This advancement in web technology facilitates a more user-centric and secure approach, empowering individuals with greater control over their personal information.

2. Eliminating the inconvenience of repeatedly recreating music playlists for different apps is a common desire. Web 5 presents a solution that makes this repetitive task a thing of the past.

### Application Workflow

In this scenario, Groove has the capability to write to Alice's decentralized web node (DWN) and incorporates a new entry.

Tidal, granted read access to Alice's Decentralized Web Node (DWN), is able to fetch the recently added entry by Groove. As a result, Alice now enjoys the seamless availability of her playlist on both applications.

With the introduction of access to Alice's Decentralized Web Node (DWN), as an artist, she can leverage this transparency to enhance the marketability of her music. This stands in stark contrast to data stored in silos, which are typically manipulated solely by companies.
